Hello and nice to have seduced you to "my" website. Currently I am learning how to build an elementary static one. Later on, when I do understand how, I will add dynamic features to it.

My main objective is to retrieve and use **available online data**, take it from different areas for instance like **meteorology, finance, health, geography**, etc. apply models to it, understand the results with their impacts and try to make forecasts.

On the technical side Big Data, Quantum Computing, and AI (artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning) are topics that are able to deflect my attention away from my "Data Science" goals. Hopefully I will find the time to build similar notebooks and publish them accordingly.

You're welcome to contact me on

Bye now.
