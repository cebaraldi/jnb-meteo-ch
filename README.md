Hello and nice to have seduced you to "my" wwebsite. Currently I am learning how to build an elementary static one. Maybe later on I will try to add some dynamic features to it...

My main objective is to learn how to retrieve and use **freely available online data**, combine data from different areas like **meteorology, finance, health, geography**, etc. applying models to it, understanding the results with their impacts and try to make forecasts. Modelling, without being able to make predictions, does not seem to be of great use.

On the technical side Big Data, Quantum Computing, and AI (artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning) are interesting topics that are able to deflect my attention away from my "Data Science" goals. For instance, in the context of Big Data, I have built a local "Beowulf Cluster" with currently three PC's managed using Ansible. Only with that mini-cluster I was able to read and work on huge amounts of meteorological data from my home office.
